## :memo: About the Project <a name="1"></a>
  This project sends random comics to user through email, for this a user has to subscribe by email id.

  A background job (cron job) is used for scheduling the mails. Comic is fetched by making API call to the xkcd url.
  
  XKCD is a webcomic created in 2005 by American author Randall Munroe.
